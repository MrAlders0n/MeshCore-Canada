# Find an observer location code

An observer uses a real three-letter airport code as a broad location label. It does not define a MeshCore region boundary.

Use the nearest sensible code for the observer's actual area. Use the same code in every broker entry.

## About this list

The [canonical location-code data](location-codes.json) generates the search tool and the command-builder suggestions. It is a curated Canadian quick list, not a complete official airport-code registry.

If the nearest real airport code is missing:

1. verify it against a reliable airport source;
2. type the three-letter code into a method that accepts free text; and
3. ask MeshCore Canada to add the friendly place name.

Do not use `CAN` for Canada; it is an airport code for Guangzhou. Do not use placeholders such as `XXX` or `HOME`.
