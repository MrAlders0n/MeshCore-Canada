# Set up a network observer

An observer forwards nearby MeshCore packet data to CoreScope. It does not decrypt private messages or need to repeat traffic.

## How the pieces fit

<ol class="mc-analyzer-flow">
  <li><strong>Radio</strong><span>hears nearby MeshCore packets</span></li>
  <li><strong>Observer</strong><span>forwards the packet data</span></li>
  <li><strong>MeshCore Canada</strong><span>receives it through two shared servers</span></li>
  <li><strong>Live tools</strong><span>CoreScope shows observers and packets</span></li>
</ol>

The shared servers use MQTT, but you do not need to learn MQTT before choosing a setup.

!!! warning "Observers share what they hear"
    Observer details and heard packet data can appear in CoreScope. Do not transmit sensitive information. Read [Observer data and privacy](data-collection-access.md) before turning one on.

## Choose your setup

Start with what already manages your radio.

<div class="mc-method-chooser" id="observer-method-chooser">
  <label for="observer-method">
    <strong>What is already part of this setup?</strong>
    <select id="observer-method">
      <option value="">Choose one</option>
      <option value="remote-term">RemoteTerm manages the radio</option>
      <option value="home-assistant">Home Assistant has the MeshCore integration</option>
      <option value="pymc">A PyMC repeater service is already running</option>
      <option value="usb-host">A Linux or macOS computer stays beside a USB radio</option>
      <option value="wifi-board">A supported Wi-Fi LoRa board can be dedicated to observing</option>
    </select>
  </label>
  <div class="mc-method-result" id="observer-method-result" role="status" tabindex="-1" hidden></div>
</div>

The same choices are listed here:

| Your current setup | Recommended method | Host that must stay on |
|---|---|---|
| RemoteTerm already manages the radio | [RemoteTerm](remoteterm.md) | The RemoteTerm host |
| Home Assistant already has MeshCore | [Home Assistant](builds/meshcore-ha.md) | Home Assistant |
| PyMC already manages a repeater | [PyMC](builds/pymc.md) | The PyMC host |
| A Linux or macOS host is connected by USB | [MCtoMQTT](builds/mctomqtt.md) | The USB host |
| A supported Wi-Fi LoRa board can be dedicated | [Standalone MQTT firmware](builds/mqtt-firmware.md) | No separate host |

If none fit, ask in the [MeshCore Canada forum](https://forum.meshcore.ca/) before installing anything new.

## What every setup needs

Whichever setup you choose, you need:

- a radio already set for the local mesh;
- a real three-letter [location code](iata-codes.md);
- the MeshCore Canada primary and backup addresses;
- encrypted connections with certificate checks;
- packet publishing, not status-only publishing; and
- an always-on host or board.

The Canadian onboarding baseline is **USA/Canada (Recommended)**, `910.525 MHz / 62.5 kHz / SF7 / CR5`, with 3-byte path hashes. A published local setting takes priority.

For exact broker fields, use the [observer connection reference](broker-reference.md).

## Finish the check

Setup is not finished when a screen says “connected.” You are done when:

1. your observer appears in [CoreScope Observers](https://live.meshcore.ca/#/observers); and
2. a packet heard by your radio appears in [CoreScope Packets](https://live.meshcore.ca/#/packets).

Finish with [Check your observer](verify.md). If something fails, go to [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md).
