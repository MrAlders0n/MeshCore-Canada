# Experimental 1 W Solar Repeater

This unverified design combines an Ikoka Stick 0.4.0, a solar power manager,
a filtered RF path, and a fabricated enclosure.

<div class="mc-guide-status" data-status="experimental" markdown>

**Do not build or deploy this design without electrical, RF, and site review.**
Its firmware target, electrical design, optional telemetry, measurements, and
climate limits have not been reproduced.

## Is this build appropriate?

This is a specialized backbone or long-range experiment, not a default
upgrade. Coordinate with nearby communities and show that the site needs it
before changing coverage or traffic patterns.

Use the [300 mW draft build](repeater-solar-300mw-diy-build.md) or a reviewed pre-built path unless a network operator and hardware/RF reviewer agree that this experiment addresses a measured need.

## Before you start

!!! danger "This combines high-power RF, lithium batteries, charging, soldering, cutting, and an outdoor elevated installation"
    Verify every component and limit from current manufacturer documentation. Keep an antenna and reviewed RF path attached before any transmit test. Do not energize a battery or charger path when polarity, protection, wiring, temperature, or expected readings are unknown.

<ul class="mc-checklist">
  <li>The local network need and cross-region effects are documented.</li>
  <li>The exact Ikoka hardware and repeater firmware target are confirmed and recoverable by USB.</li>
  <li>A hardware/electrical reviewer approves the battery, charger, panel, wiring, protection, optional telemetry, and enclosure thermal plan.</li>
  <li>An RF reviewer approves the radio, filter, feed line, antenna, connectors, and site.</li>
  <li>A structural/site review covers the finished mass, panel area, mount, wind, ice, snow, cable route, and access.</li>
  <li>The build will remain supervised on the bench until its test record is approved.</li>
</ul>

## What this build changes

The procedure cuts and drills an enclosure, bonds a solar panel with epoxy and sealant, modifies the mounting system, connects a high-power RF path and filter, assembles a lithium power system, and may remove display pins for optional telemetry. Several changes are difficult or impossible to undo without replacing parts.

## Assembly stages

<div class="mc-stage-list">
  <section class="mc-build-stage" data-stage="stop">
    <h3>Stage 1 — Review and dry-fit</h3>
    <p>Confirm all revisions, dimensions, electrical limits, connector paths, filter orientation, clearances, printed parts, cable bends, vent location, panel location, and service access before cutting or bonding.</p>
    <p><strong>Checkpoint:</strong> the reviewed schematic, RF path, and mechanical layout agree with the exact parts in hand.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="mc-build-stage">
    <h3>Stage 2 — Prepare the enclosure and panel</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Measure the panel junction box and mark the enclosure cutout from the actual parts.</li>
      <li>Use an appropriate pilot opening and cutting tool with the enclosure empty and safely supported.</li>
      <li>Deburr and clean the cutout, then dry-fit the panel and cable route.</li>
      <li>Bond and clamp only with a reviewed material-compatible process. Let it cure for the full manufacturer time.</li>
      <li>Apply the reviewed weather seal without blocking drainage or venting.</li>
    </ol>

  <section class="mc-build-stage">
    <h3>Stage 3 — Install the mounting plate, filter, bulkhead, and vent</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Fit the reviewed spacers and mounting plate without stressing the enclosure.</li>
      <li>Mount the filter with identified input and output ports and adequate cable bend radius.</li>
      <li>Drill and deburr the bulkhead and vent holes by test-fitting the actual hardware.</li>
      <li>Install seals, bulkhead, and vent according to their documentation.</li>

    <h3>Stage 4 — Review the power-manager startup modification</h3>
    <p><strong>Do not bridge the power manager's boot-button pads.</strong> That modification has not been reproduced or reviewed.</p>
    <p>Before considering any change, require the exact schematic, failure modes, warranty impact, soldering method, startup test, and rollback to be approved by a hardware reviewer.</p>

    <h3>Stage 5 — Mount the radio and decide on optional telemetry</h3>

## Check the readings

No numeric acceptance range has been peer-reviewed for this page. Do not substitute guessed voltages or currents.

<div class="mc-table-wrap" markdown>

| Check | Acceptable result | Stop condition |
|---|---|---|
| Disconnected continuity | No unintended short on the documented supply or RF paths | Unexpected continuity or uncertain meter setup |
| Connector polarity | Measurements match the reviewed schematic and manufacturer pinout | Any disagreement or unknown pin |
| Solar, battery, and output values | Each measured value is within every connected component's current documentation | Missing limit or out-of-range value |
| First power | Stable expected startup with no heat, odour, swelling, smoke, noise, or cycling | Any abnormal physical or electrical behaviour |
| RF path | Correct band, filter direction, connections, and attached antenna before transmit | Missing antenna, loose/forced connector, unknown filter response |
| Optional telemetry | Independently reproduced measurement and firmware behaviour | Unverified wiring, address, calibration, or build target |

</div>

## Test it on the bench

<ul class="mc-checklist">
  <li>Record exact parts, revisions, source documents, schematic, photographs, polarity, and measured values.</li>
  <li>Use supervised and current-limited first-power methods appropriate to the reviewed hardware.</li>
  <li>Confirm the unit starts after each intended power source is applied and after a controlled power interruption.</li>
  <li>Confirm the repeater's identity, firmware, radio, region, path, advert, and access settings survive reboot.</li>
  <li>Confirm a nearby companion receives an advert and the planned local routing test succeeds.</li>
  <li>Measure the RF/power behaviour using the reviewer's approved method; do not infer output from a firmware setting alone.</li>
  <li>Run a supervised charge/load test that covers the reviewed conditions without exceeding component limits.</li>
  <li>Inspect cable strain and seals, then complete an enclosure-appropriate water-resistance test.</li>
  <li>Prove USB recovery and document the removal/access plan.</li>
</ul>

Do not deploy until a hardware/electrical reviewer, RF reviewer, and site owner approve the completed test record.

## Recovery and undo

If a check fails, stop transmitting and disconnect solar, USB, and battery power using the reviewed safe sequence. Move the equipment to a suitable supervised work area. Do not reconnect a warm, swollen, damaged, leaking, or otherwise questionable lithium battery. Restore firmware by USB only after the electrical/RF fault is understood.

Cutouts, epoxy, removed pins, and solder bridges may be irreversible. Replace uncertain components rather than improvising a repair. The safe rollback from the optional telemetry branch is to omit it before modification, not to assume removed hardware can be restored.

## Maintenance

No interval is approved. The site record must define inspections for mounting, panel/bond, water entry, vent, seals, corrosion, cables/connectors, filter, battery condition, charge behaviour, measured values, firmware/configuration, radio verification, and physical recovery. Reinspect after any severe event or unexplained behaviour defined by the site reviewer.
