# Choose an antenna and feed line

Most LoRa devices ship with a very basic factory antenna that performs poorly. The Ottawa mesh community has tested many replacements, and the antennas below are highly recommended as reliable upgrades for the Canadian 902–928 MHz band.

<div class="mc-guide-status" data-status="draft" markdown>

**Check before buying.** These antennas have worked well in Ottawa and other meshes, but product revisions change. Confirm the current datasheet, connector, dimensions, mounting needs, and radio compatibility with the manufacturer before ordering.

</div>

!!! danger "Disconnect power before changing an antenna"
    Make sure your device is disconnected from power and battery when swapping an antenna. Since these devices can transmit radio signals, turning on a device without an antenna can damage it. [See more information here](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/335912/can-i-break-a-radio-tranceiving-device-by-operating-it-with-no-antenna-connected){ target="_blank" rel="noopener" }.

## Check compatibility first

<ul class="mc-checklist">
  <li>The antenna is specified for the Canadian 902–928 MHz band.</li>
  <li>The connector family and polarity match: SMA and RP-SMA can look similar but do not mate electrically in the same way.</li>
  <li>The connector gender, pigtail, and feed line form one complete path.</li>
  <li>The device and mount can support the antenna's size, weight, wind load, and cable strain.</li>
  <li>Outdoor connectors can be weatherproofed and inspected without trapping water.</li>
  <li>The current product page and datasheet support the details used in your decision.</li>
</ul>

## Companion antennas

These are SMA antennas and are more compact, yet they've consistently shown excellent performance in Ottawa and other meshes. We recommend any of the options listed here.

!!! warning "SMA vs. RP-SMA"
    Pay close attention to what connection type a companion or repeater has, since some come with Reverse Polarity SMA (RP-SMA). You will need an adapter to connect your SMA antenna, or you will need to buy an RP-SMA antenna.

## Repeater omni antennas

These are N-type antennas and are best suited for repeaters. At an absolute minimum, all repeaters should use the Alfa antenna. It is a major reason the Ottawa mesh performs as well as it does. MrAlders0n has made a link between a repeater and a companion at 110 km distance with an Alfa on both ends.

If you want something larger and higher-performing, we have tested the Seeed 1300 mm fiberglass antenna with excellent results. Please note that it is 1.3 metres long. We only recommend this antenna for repeaters installed at significant height (around 30 m AGL or higher) and intended for long-distance links or backbone use.

## Repeater directional antennas

Directional antennas are intended for fixed repeaters and long-distance point-to-point or point-to-multipoint links. All antennas listed here use N-type connectors and are suitable for permanent outdoor installations.

</div>

A permanent repeater antenna is a complete installation decision, not just a gain number. Include feed-line loss, connector count, pattern, local RF conditions, structure, lightning and grounding review, weather, and safe access.

## Antenna cables

For short, high-quality LMR-240 cables, [Infinite Cables](https://www.infinitecables.com/) in Toronto is the best source we've found. Their cables are on the expensive side, but the build quality is excellent and they offer a wide variety of lengths and connector combinations to suit any installation. Use the shortest practical cable with acceptable loss, and confirm both connectors, cable type, length, outdoor rating, bend radius, strain relief, and weather sealing.

</div>

## Record the decision

Before installation, record:

- antenna product and revision;
- published band and pattern;
- every connector and adapter in order;
- cable type and length;
- mounting and weatherproofing method;
- source links and the date checked; and
- the local test you will use after installation.

## Check after installation

With the enclosure still accessible, confirm the radio reports the intended settings, the feed line is not loose or sharply bent, the weather seal does not create a water path, and a local message test succeeds. Do not attribute a change in coverage to the antenna alone without repeatable before/after evidence.

## Finish the installation

For a fixed installation, continue to [mounting options](repeater-mounting-options.md). For a portable node, return to [companion choices](recommended-companions.md).
