# Choose a companion device

A companion is your personal MeshCore messaging device. Choose whether you want to use a phone or built-in controls, then confirm the exact model in the [official MeshCore flasher](https://meshcore.io/flasher).

<div class="mc-guide-status" data-status="draft" markdown>

**Check before buying.** These are devices to compare, not a guaranteed compatibility list. Confirm the exact model, Canadian radio band, companion firmware target, connector, and included accessories.

## Choose how you want to use it

<div class="mc-decision-grid">
  <section class="mc-decision-card">
    <h3>Phone-paired</h3>
    <p>Your phone provides the main interface and connects to the radio over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).</p>
    <p><strong>Check:</strong> phone compatibility, battery, antenna, and the exact companion target.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="mc-decision-card">
    <h3>Standalone</h3>
    <p>A display and built-in controls allow normal messaging without a phone.</p>
    <p><strong>Check:</strong> whether current firmware supports the model and all controls you need.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="mc-decision-card">
    <h3>Build your own</h3>
    <p>You choose the board, battery, enclosure, cable, and antenna.</p>
    <p><strong>Check:</strong> board revision, battery polarity and protection, enclosure fit, and every antenna connector.</p>
