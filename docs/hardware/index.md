# Choose MeshCore hardware

Choose what the device will do, then confirm the exact board and firmware target in the [official MeshCore flasher](https://meshcore.io/flasher) before buying.

**Check before buying.** Product revisions and firmware support change. Treat the linked devices as options to compare, not compatibility guarantees.
