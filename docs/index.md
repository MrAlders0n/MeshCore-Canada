## What is MeshCore

MeshCore is a long range, low power mesh protocol built on LoRa radios.  
Communities use MeshCore to create local and regional off grid communication networks.

Each community has its own governance, hardware recommendations, and expansion plans.  
This site is only an index that helps people discover their nearest MeshCore group.

If you want to start a new community in your area, you can add it by following the steps in  
[Contributing](contributing.md).
