# Privacy at MeshCore Canada

You can read this site without a MeshCore Canada or GitHub account.

## When data leaves your browser

| Action | What is sent | Where it goes |
|---|---|---|
| Search this documentation | Your search words stay in the browser | Nowhere |
| Search for a place in the region tools | The place, airport code, or postal code you enter | Checked locally first, then sent to OpenStreetMap or geocoder.ca if needed |
| Open the interactive region map | Your IP address and the visible map area | OpenStreetMap |
| Check a repeater path ID | The first byte of the public key | Beacon at dev.meshcore.ca; regional and longer-prefix comparisons stay in your browser |
| Load the GitHub star count | Your IP address and standard web request information | GitHub |
| Open an external link | Normal web request information | The named external service |
| Submit an idea or region proposal | The text and proposal details shown at review, plus anti-spam verification | MeshCore Canada’s submission service, Cloudflare Turnstile, and a public GitHub issue |

## Public submissions

Ideas and boundary proposals become public GitHub issues. Review the preview
before submitting. Do not include passwords, private keys, home addresses,
private coordinates, or other personal information.

The submission service may keep security and rate-limit logs. A retention
period has not yet been published.

## Saved on your device

Setup checklists, idea drafts, and the last Beacon region code selected in the
repeater-ID checker are saved in your browser only when you use those features.
Repeater public keys, passwords, private keys, anti-spam tokens, and location
searches are not saved there.

You can clear saved site data through your browser settings. The idea form also
provides a **Clear draft** action.

## External services

CoreScope, MQTT services, flashers, and community sites have their own
operators and privacy policies.

## Analytics

MeshCore Canada does not use site analytics.
