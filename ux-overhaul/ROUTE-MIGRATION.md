# Route migration registry

The overhaul preserves every useful public URL. The initial implementation
changes navigation and canonical journeys before moving source files.

## Canonical route state

This branch implements two new task hubs:

- `/start/`
- `/tools/`

Existing public routes remain the canonical destinations for communities,
hardware, builds, learning, contributing, and privacy. The planned aliases
`/communities/`, `/devices/`, `/builds/`, `/learn/`, `/contribute/`, and
`/policies/privacy/` are **not implemented** and must not be advertised as live.

A future alias becomes canonical only after its page or redirect exists, old
bookmarks have an automated route test, and both the production root and the
Canadaverse subpath build pass the link and browser gates.

## Staging base path

The Pi 5 build is produced with a staging site URL rooted at:

`https://canadaverse.org/meshcore-canada/`

Absolute MeshCore Canada paths must not escape that base during staging.
Production builds continue to use `https://meshcore.ca/`.
